/**
 * <b>Java Dequeue</b>
 * <p>
 * In computer science, a double-ended queue (dequeue, often abbreviated to
 * deque, pronounced deck) is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue,
 * for which elements can be added to or removed from either the front (head) or
 * back (tail).
 * 
 * Deque interfaces can be implemented using various types of collections such
 * as LinkedList or ArrayDeque classes. For example, deque can be declared as:
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * Deque deque = new LinkedList<>();
 * or
 * Deque deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
 * </code>
